# Bronco
Bronco is a programming language for building powerful text generators easily. Inspired by Tracery, it is a grammar-based text-substitution system at its heart, but is capable of much more.

This project is being worked up for UROP and SPUR summer 2022. It is eventually intended to be the procedural backbone of Project CODE, and an ICIDS paper is in the works describing it.

If you are interested in using the language itself, I’d recommend you check out the [examples](EXAMPLES.md), checking back on the [reference](REFERENCE.md) for any clarifications. 

If you want to clone the code, I’d recommend you do it through Visual Studio, but it shouldn't require any other special setup. Be warned however, that the code is currently uncommented and a little sketchy in some areas; enter at your own risk.

Please send me (Jonas) a message on Slack or Discord if you have any questions!
