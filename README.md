# Bronco
Bronco is a programming language for building powerful text generators easily. Inspired by Tracery, it is a grammar-based text-substitution system at its heart, but is capable of much more.

This project was made over the course of summer 2022 with the Quantitative Experience Design Lab at the University of Utah. It is also the [subject of a paper](http://rogel.io/content/2-publications/knochelmann2022bronco.pdf) presented at ICIDS 2022.

If you are interested in using the language itself, I’d recommend you check out the [examples](EXAMPLES.md), checking back on the [reference](REFERENCE.md) for any clarifications. You can download the [IDE Editor here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10_3WgmzaInxeLRysnRcP0lMz7Q6-fDBR)!

If you want to clone the code, I’d recommend you do it through Visual Studio, but it shouldn't require any other special setup. Be warned however, that the code is currently uncommented and a little sketchy in some areas; enter at your own risk.

Please send me (Jonas) a message on Discord or at jonas.p.knochelmann@gmail.com if you have any questions!
