# Syntax
Bronco is a programming language for building powerful text generators easily. Inspired by Tracery, it is a grammar-based text-substitution system at its heart, but is capable of much more.

## Syntax
Each Bronco file is made up of a number of *bags*. Every bag is denoted with a `@symbol`, followed by a number of newline separated items, which is mostly normal text.


```
@bag
first item
second item
third item

@anotherBag
more items
one last one
```
